# Module 2 Challenge:  Portfolio

I have created a basic portfolio that gives information about myself, the work that I have completed, and how to contact me.  

This page was built using HTML and CSS.

I intend for this portfolio to be something that I add to over the course of this program so that I may use it as a resource in applying for jobs after I earn my certificate.

There are two "live" pages in the "About My Work" section:  Run Buddy and Horiseon.  These are both based on work that I have completed in the first two weeks of the course.  Both of these pages will open in a new tab.  There are also two placeholder images, text, and links.  They are written so that hovering your cursor over them will show that they are links, but they will not link to a page.

Three media queries were created for this page to allow for the following screen size breakpoints: 980px, 768px, and 575px.  These are the same breakpoints modeled within the Run Buddy project.

My portfolio can be found here: https://catherinecunningham.github.io/mod-2-challenge-portfolio/
